                    <p>Users of the Service may be Clients, Freelancers, or Agencies (as each is defined in the User
                    Agreement).
                    Information You Provide to Us
                    When you use the Service, you may provide us with information about you. This may include your name
                    and contact information, financial information to make or receive payment for services obtained
                    through the Jobs233 platform, or information to help us fill out tax forms. When you use the
                        Service,
                    we may also collect information related to your use of the Service and aggregate this with
                    information about other users. This helps us improve our Services for you. You may also provide us
                    with information about your contacts or friends if, for example, you’d like to add those contacts to
                    a message room. Agencies may also provide us with information about Freelancers associated with the
                    Agency.
                    Personal Information: In the course of using the Service (whether as a Client or Freelancer or
                    Agency), we may require or otherwise collect information that identifies you as a specific
                    individual and can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Examples of Personal
                    Information include your name, email address, company address, billing address, and phone number.
                    Payment Information: If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will also collect
                    certain payment information, such as credit card or other financial account information, and billing
                    address.
                    Identity Verification: We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth or taxpayer
                    identification number, to validate your identity or as may be required by law, such as to complete
                    tax filings. We may request documents to verify this information, such as a copy of your
                    government-issued identification or photo or a billing statement.
                    Biometric Identifiers or Service Interaction Information: We may collect Personal Information such
                    as a photograph of your face, a selfie, or data about your interactions with the Service to verify
                    your identity and to detect fraud, identity theft, or other misuse of your account through the use
                    of facial recognition and other technologies. We may request documents to verify this information,
                    such as a copy of your government-issued identification. From time to time, Jobs233 may require you
                    to take and submit an additional or updated image of your face for comparison to your
                    government-issued identification. The biometric identifiers or information collected are used only
                    for identity verification and platform security and use integrity purposes.
                    General Audience Service: The Service is general audience and intended for users 18 and older. We do
                    not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone younger than age 18. If we become aware that
                    a child younger than 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will use commercially
                    reasonable efforts to delete such information from our files. If you are the parent or legal
                    guardian of a child younger than age 18 and believe that Jobs233 has collected Personal Information
                    from your child, please contact us at: legalnotices@jobs233.com .
                    Non-Identifying Information/Usernames: We also may collect other information, such as zip codes,
                    demographic data, information regarding your use of the Service, and general project-related data
                    (“Non-Identifying Information”). We may aggregate information collected from Jobs233 registered and
                    non-registered users (“Jobs233 Users”). In some cases, we may render Personal Information
                        (generally,
                    email address) into a form of Non-Identifying Information referred to in this Privacy Policy as
                    “Hashed Information.” This is typically accomplished using a mathematical process (commonly known as
                    a hash function) to convert information into a code. The code does not identify you directly, but it
                    may be used to connect your activity and interests.
                    Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information: Certain Non-Identifying Information would
                    be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a
                    way that enables you to be identified (for example, combining information with your name). But the
                    same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or
                    combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may
                    combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information, but Jobs233 will treat the
                    combined information as Personal Information.
                    Collection of Third Party Personal Information: We collect the following personal information from
                    you about your contacts or friends: First name, last name, and email address when you provide it to
                    us for the purpose of adding your contacts to a message room.
                    You do not have a statutory obligation to provide us with any information, but you may have a
                    contractual obligation to do so, and if we do not receive certain information from you, then we will
                    not be able to provide our Service to you. If you have any questions regarding whether provision of
                    information is mandatory and the consequences for withholding such information, please contact us
                    using the contact information below.
                    Information Received from Third Parties
                    Third parties may also give us information about you. If we combine that information with
                    information about you collected through the Service, we will still treat that combined information
                    as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
                    We also may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the
                    information we collect with outside records or third parties may provide information in connection
                    with a co-marketing agreement or at your request (such as if you choose to sign in with a
                    third-party service). If we combine the information we receive from others with information we
                    collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as described in this Privacy
                    Policy.
                    Information Collected Automatically
                    Like other online companies, we receive technical information when you use our Services. We use
                    these technologies to analyze how people use the Service, to improve how our Site functions, to save
                    your log-in information for future sessions, and to serve you with advertisements that may interest
                    you.
                    We and our third party service providers, including analytics and third party content providers, may
                    automatically collect certain information from you whenever you access or interact with the Service.
                    This information may include, among other information, the browser and operating system you are
                    using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Service, the search terms you entered into
                    a search engine that led you to the Service, areas within the Service that you visited, which links
                    you clicked on, which pages or content you viewed and for how long, other similar information and
                    statistics about your interactions, such as content response times, download errors and length of
                    visits to certain pages and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with
                    websites. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we
                    collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics,
                    and site functionality.
                    The information we collect also includes the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other unique device
                    identifier (“Device Identifier”) for any device (computer, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) used to
                    access the Service. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to
                    the device you use to access the Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device
                    Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers
                    with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Service.
                    Jobs233 and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the
                    website, track users’ movement around the website, the desktop app, and the mobile app, and to
                    gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. The technology used to collect
                    information automatically from Jobs233 Users may include the following:
                    Cookies: Like many websites, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service
                    providers use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to
                    your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use both persistent cookies that remain on
                    your computer or similar device (such as to save your registration ID and login password for future
                    logins to the Service and to track your compliance with the Jobs233 Terms of Service) and session ID
                    cookies, which expire at the end of your browser session (for example, to enable certain features of
                    the Service, to better understand how Jobs233 Users interact with the Service and to monitor
                    aggregate usage by Jobs233 Users and web traffic routing on the Service). You can control the use of
                    cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use
                    of certain features or functionality of the Service. For further information on cookies and how they
                    are used for the Service, please visit our Cookie Policy at
                    https://www.jobs233.com/legal#cookie-policy.
                    Web Beacons: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may also
                    employ software technology known as “web beacons” and/or “tracking tags” to help us keep track of
                    what content on our Service is effective and to serve relevant advertising to you. Web beacons are
                    small graphics with a unique identifier that may be invisible to you, and which are used to track
                    the online activity of Internet users. Web beacons are embedded in the web pages you review or email
                    messages you receive. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes,
                    including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Service, to monitor how Jobs233 Users
                    navigate the Service, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how
                    many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
                    Embedded Scripts: We and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may
                    also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code
                    that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links
                    you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is
                    deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Service.
                    In addition, we and our marketing partners, affiliates, analytics, and service providers may use a
                    variety of other technologies (such as tags) that collect similar information for security and fraud
                    detection purposes and we may use third parties to perform these services on our behalf.
                    HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
                    Jobs233 does not respond to Do-Not-Track signals.
                    Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track”
                    signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants
                    as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Jobs233
                        does
                    not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find
                    out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.
                    The General Data Protection Regulation: Data Processing Agreement
                    To streamline compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), Jobs233 has posted a
                    Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) governing the relationship between the Customer (as defined in the
                    DPA) acting as a data controller or processor, as applicable (and as defined in the DPA), of
                    personal data under European Data Protection Legislation; and Jobs233 (acting as a data processor or
                    subprocessor, as applicable).
                    Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by you and Jobs233, to the extent Jobs233 processes any EU
                    personal data for you as a controller (as defined by the General Data Protection Regulation (EU)
                    2016/679) in your role as a Customer, the Data Processing Agreement applies.
                    Work Diaries and Work View
                    We collect information about a Freelancer’s work for a Client, including automatically collected
                    information about work on a particular project. If a Freelancer enables Work Diaries, we will share
                    Work Diaries with the relevant Client and Agency. We tell Freelancers when we are capturing
                    information for the Work Diary and allow Freelancers to block such data sharing.
                    As part of the Service, when enabled by a Freelancer, we collect information about a Freelancer’s
                    work on a project for a Client. This feature is known as Work Diary. Work Diaries include
                    information provided by the Freelancer, such as a memo, as well as automatically gathered
                    information about work on a project, such as number of mouseclicks and keyboard strokes and
                    regularly taken screenshots (which may include a webcam picture of you if you have enabled this
                    feature in your settings). In order to use Work Diaries, you must download and install the Team App
                    software from www.jobs233.com.
                    We will share information contained in Work Diaries with the relevant Client and with any manager or
                    administrator of any applicable Freelancer Agency. We inform Freelancers each time we capture
                    information for Work Diary. As set forth in our Terms of Service, End User License Agreement, and
                    help pages on the Site, a Freelancer may choose to block or delete the screen shot and associated
                    data for a recorded work interval, but then the Freelancer may not be paid for that work interval.
                    Jobs233 may use de-identified or aggregated information from Work Diaries for statistical analysis,
                    product development, marketing and research.
                    User Profiles
                    Freelancers may create a profile, with certain or all information publicly available. Clients and
                    Agencies may also create organization profiles.
                    You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, and may
                    include Personal Information, photographs, examples of your work, information on work previously
                    performed via the Service and outside the Service, skills, tests taken, test scores, hourly pay
                    rates and earnings information, feedback/rating information and other information, including your
                    username (“Profile”). The information in your Profile may be visible to all Jobs233 Users and the
                    general public subject to the privacy choices you make within your Jobs233 Profile. You may edit
                    certain information in your Profile via your account and may choose to limit who is able to view
                    certain content you post to your Profile. Clients and Agencies of associated individual users or
                    companies may also have the opportunity to create an organization Profile. If, in any case, you
                    believe that an unauthorized profile has been created about you, you can request for it to be
                    removed by contacting us at https://support.jobs233.com or legalnotices@jobs233.com.
                    Identity Verification
                    We place a premium on trust in our Service, so we may take steps to verify your identity.
                    Before a Freelancer can complete registration on the Service, or at any time thereafter, we may
                    request or re-request identity verification. Without limiting the manner in which we request
                    identify verification, we may require Freelancers to participate in a video call after submitting
                    their government issued ID to enable us to confirm that the Freelancer is indeed the individual in
                    the ID. We may record such video calls and take screenshots of the user during the call. Jobs233 may
                    use the information obtained from Identity Verification for purposes of verifying your identity,
                    enforcing our Terms of Service and other agreements, and preventing fraud.
                    Messaging
                    Freelancers, Agencies, and Clients may communicate with each other through the Service. For example,
                    Freelancers, Agencies, and Clients may wish to discuss Client needs and Freelancer work proposals.
                    If you communicate with an Agency or Client, that Agency or Client will also be a “data controller”
                    with respect to such communications.
                    Community Forums
                    We may offer public forums or blogs. If you participate, your comments and questions will be
                    publicly displayed.
                    The Service may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, on
                    blogs, through interactive features on Jobs233 and through other communication functionality
                    (“Community Forums”). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post
                    questions, comments, or other content (collectively, “User Forum Content”). Please note that certain
                    information, such as your name and Profile may be publicly displayed on the Service along with your
                    User Forum Content. Please note that your use of Community Forums is subject to the Jobs233 Forum
                    Rules and our Terms of Service.
                    Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public — others will have access to your User
                    Forum Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose
                    Personal Information in your User Forum Content or use Community Forums to link to your Profile,
                    that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy
                    will not apply.
                    To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at

                    Work Listings Through the Service
                    If you choose to post a work listing via the Service as a Client, the contents of such listing will
                    be viewable publicly, unless you designate the listing as only viewable through the Service or as
                    private using the settings available on the applicable website. Work listings include information
                    such as budget, location, history of work listing(s) by the Client, the names of other Freelancers
                    performing work for the Client, Client feedback and rating information and timing of project
                    performance.
                    Feedback
                    We collect feedback from Jobs233 Users about their experience with other Jobs233 Users of our
                        Service.
                    Please note that any feedback you provide via the Service or feedback provided about you is publicly
                    viewable via the Service. On very rare occasions, we may remove feedback pursuant to the relevant
                    provisions of our Terms of Service, including the Terms of Use.
                    Email to Friends and Referral Program
                    Jobs233 lets you send project postings to friends via email. Jobs233 also offers the ability to send
                    friends emails about providing or purchasing services through the Service. You should only provide
                    Jobs233 contact information from individuals who are familiar to you and with their consent. If you
                    choose to use either feature, your friend’s email address will be used to send the requested posting
                    and your email address will be used to copy you on the message to your friend or to send the message
                    on your behalf. Jobs233 stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email
                    and tracking the success of our referral program.
                    Your friend may contact us at https://support.jobs233.com or legalnotices@jobs233.com to request
                        that
                    we remove this information from our database.
                    Social Networking Services
                    You may register for an account directly with our Site, or through a social networking service. If
                    you register with a social networking service (or later link your account to one), we will collect
                    certain information about you from that social networking service, and what we collect depends on
                    your privacy settings with that social networking service. The Service may also allow you to “like”
                    or share content with social networking services.
                    You may register to join the Service directly via the Service or by logging into your account with a
                    third party social networking service (“SNS”) via our Service (e.g., Facebook, Github and other
                    third party services that let you sign in using your existing credentials with those services). If
                    you choose to register via an SNS, or to later link your account with the Service to your account
                    with an SNS, we will use the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your name,
                    email address, gender and other information you make publicly available via the SNS) to create your
                    account. Note that the information we collect from and through an SNS may depend on the privacy
                    settings you have set with the SNS and the permissions you grant to us in connection with linking
                    your account with the Service to your account with an SNS. Other than what we may share with the SNS
                    as described below, the Personal Information an SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent
                    of our Service, and Jobs233 is not responsible for it.
                    The Jobs233 Service also may permit additional interactions between it and a third party website,
                    service, or other content provider, such as enabling you to “like” or share content to a third party
                    SNS. If you choose to “like” or share content, or to otherwise share information from or via our
                    Service with a third party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the
                    third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Service (and we may have
                    access to information about you from that third party). These features may collect your IP address,
                    which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
                    properly. Your interactions with third parties through an SNS or similar features are governed by
                    the respective privacy policies of those third parties.
                    You represent that you are entitled to use your SNS account for the purposes described herein
                    without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern the SNS, and without obligating
                    Jobs233 to pay any fees or making Jobs233 subject to any usage limitations imposed by such SNS. You
                    can disable the link between your Jobs233 account and your SNS account at any time through the
                    “Settings” section of our Service. Please note that your relationship with any SNS is governed
                    solely by your agreement(s) with such SNS. If your SNS account terminates, then functions enabled
                    through the link between your Jobs233 account and your SNS account will terminate as well.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">2. USE OF INFORMATION</p>

                    To contact you with administrative communications and Jobs233 newsletters, marketing or promotional
                    materials (on behalf of Jobs233 or third parties) and other information that may be of interest to

                    please follow the instructions in the Your Choices and Rights section, below.
                    To tailor content we display to you and offers we may present to you, both on the Service and
                    elsewhere online.
                    To administer and develop our business relationship with you and, if applicable, the corporation or
                    other legal entity you represent.
                    To assess your proposal to perform a freelance project for Jobs233 and prepare related governmental
                    and internal statistics reports.
                    To enforce and comply with the law, including to conduct an investigation, to protect the property
                    and rights of Jobs233 or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to
                    prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, fraudulent,
                    unethical or legally actionable activity. We may also use Device Identifiers to identify Jobs233
                    Users.
                    For the purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as
                    further described in this Privacy Policy.
                    We use your Personal Information for the purposes described above:
                    To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You. Much of our processing of Personal Information is to
                    meet our contractual obligations to our investors, or to take steps at Users' request in
                    anticipation of entering into a contract with them.
                    For Our Legitimate Interests. In many cases, we handle Personal Information on the grounds that it
                    furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities, such as the following, in ways that are
                    not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:
                    Providing our Site and Service.
                    Detecting security incidents, protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal
                    activity, and prosecuting those responsible for that activity.
                    Measuring interest and engagement in our Services.
                    Short-term, transient use, such as contextual customization of ads.
                    Improving, upgrading or enhancing our Services.
                    Developing new products and services.

                    to comply with our legal obligations.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">3. DATA RETENTION</p>
                    Unless you request that we delete certain information (see Your Choices and Rights below), we retain

                    choose to provide us with Personal Information, we encourage you to routinely update the data to
                    ensure that we have accurate and up-to-date information about you.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">4. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</p>
                    We may share information about you to provide the Services, for legal and investigative purposes, in
                    connection with sweepstakes and promotions, or if we are part of a merger or acquisition. We may
                    also share non-identifying information with third parties. You have choices as to whether we share
                    your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.
                    We may share aggregated Non-Identifying Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying
                    Information (including, without limitation, Hashed Information) to third parties. We do not share
                    your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties’ marketing purposes unless we
                    first provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to or opt-out of such sharing. We may also share
                    the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the
                    time you provide your information, with your consent, as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy,
                    or in the following circumstances:
                    Information about Freelancers Shared with Clients, Agencies, Jobs233 Payroll Vendors, and
                    Partners of
                    The Jobs233 Foundation Initiative: We share information regarding Freelancers who have entered
                    into a
                    contract with a Client or who have elected to participate in Jobs233 Payroll, including information
                    in Work Diaries and work history, with Clients, Agencies and Jobs233 Payroll vendors. Note that if a
                    Freelancer is suspended from the Jobs233 Service, we may share that information with Clients for
                    whom
                    that Freelancer has worked or submitted proposals for work. We may also share information with
                    Agencies to whom Freelancers are associated for a particular work project. If you choose to view a
                    job post or submit a proposal for work as a Freelancer via the Service, we may share relevant
                    information with the applicable Client(s), including, but not limited to, the information contained
                    in your Freelancer Profile. If you choose to participate in The Jobs233 Foundation Initiative as a
                    Freelancer, we may share information relevant to your participation in the program with partners of
                    Jobs233 who provide support to Freelancers through that program.
                    Information about Clients and Agencies Shared with Freelancers: If you have entered into a service
                    contract or agreed to use Jobs233 Payroll with another user, we may provide him/her with your name,
                    company address, billing address, or tax ID or VAT number in order to complete the transaction or to
                    facilitate the resolution of a claim or dispute. The user receiving your information is not allowed
                    to use it for purposes unrelated to the transaction, such as to contact you for marketing purposes,
                    unless you have expressly consented to it.
                    Service Providers: We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to
                    provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services (e.g., without limitation,
                    maintenance services, database management, web analytics and online advertising, payment processing,
                    fraud detection and improvement of Jobs233’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Service
                    is used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information in order to perform these
                    tasks on our behalf.
                    What Happens If You Agree to Receive Information from Third Parties or Request that We Share Your
                    Information: You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers
                    from one or more third parties. If you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared,
                    your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to
                    the privacy policy and practices of that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy
                    policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive
                    communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly. You also may
                    request, sometimes through your use of an SNS or similar interactive feature or third party
                    application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so
                    under those circumstances.
                    Legal and Investigative Purposes: Jobs233 will share information with government agencies as
                    required
                    by law in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or
                    law enforcement requirements and, including without limitation, in connection with reporting
                    earnings. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce
                    and comply with the law. We will disclose information about you to government or law enforcement
                    officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to
                    respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), or, at the request of
                    governmental authorities or other third parties conducting an investigation where we determine in
                    our sole discretion the disclosure is necessary to (a) protect the property and rights of Jobs233 or
                    a third party, (b) protect the safety of the public or any person, or (c) prevent or stop activity
                    we may consider to be, or pose a risk of being, illegal, fraudulent, unethical or legally actionable
                    activity.
                    Internal and Business Transfers: Jobs233 may share information, including Personal Information, with
                    its parent company Jobs233 Inc., and any current or future subsidiaries or affiliates, primarily for
                    business and operational purposes, including activities such as IT management, for them to provide
                    services to you, or support and supplement the Services we provide. We may sell, transfer, or
                    otherwise share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a
                    merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets (including, in each case, as part of the
                    due-diligence process with any potential acquiring entity) or in the event of bankruptcy.
                    Sweepstakes, Contests, and Promotions: We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions
                    (any, a “Promotion”) that may require registration. By participating in a Promotion, you are
                    agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements
                    of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use
                    your name, voice, likeness, or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with
                    the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to
                    third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including,
                    without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law
                    or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winner’s list.

                        PARTIES</p>
                    We may work with advertising agencies and vendors who use technology to help us understand how
                    people use our Site. These vendors may use technologies to serve you advertisements that may
                    interest you. You can choose to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising.
                    Jobs233 works with (or may in the future work with) network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics
                    service providers and other vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Service,
                    including pages viewed and the actions taken when visiting the Service; to serve our advertisements
                    on other websites, within mobile apps and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information
                    regarding the use of the Service and the effectiveness of our advertisements. Our service providers
                    may collect certain information about your visits to and activity on the Service as well as other
                    websites or services, they may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device
                    (including cookies and web beacons), and may use that information to show you targeted
                    advertisements. Some of these parties may collect Personal Information when you visit the Service or
                    other online websites and services. We may also share certain Non-Identifying Information with these
                    parties, including Hashed Information, in connection with the services they provide to us. If you
                    wish to opt out of interest-based advertising, click here (or if located in the European Union,
                    click here). If you choose to opt out, please note you will continue to receive generic ads.
                    While we may use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services, some of these

                    According to applicable law, you may have certain choices and rights associated with your personal
                    information.
                    Communication Preferences.
                    Registered Jobs233 Users may update their choices regarding the types of communications you receive
                    from us through your online account.
                    You may opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the opt-out instructions provided
                    in those emails. Please note that we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating
                    to your account or use of the Service (for example, administrative and service announcements) via
                    email and other means and these transactional account messages may be unaffected if you opt-out from
                    receiving marketing communications.
                    You may opt-out of receiving text messages by replying “STOP” to any text message received.
                    Registered Jobs233 Users who access the Service by using an Jobs233 mobile application may, with
                    permission, receive push notifications. Similarly, registered Jobs233 Users who access the
                    Service by
                    using certain desktop browsers may, with permission, receive push notifications. Notification
                    preferences can be modified in the settings menu for the mobile application or the applicable
                    browser.
                    Data Subject Rights.
                    In accordance with applicable law, you may have the right to:
                    Access Personal Information about you, including: (i) confirming whether we are processing your
                    personal information; (ii) obtaining access to or a copy of your personal information.
                    Request Correction of your personal information where it is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated. In
                    some cases, you can update your personal information within your Jobs233 account by logging in and
                    visiting settings/user settings.
                    Request Deletion, Anonymization or Blocking of your personal information when processing is based on
                    your consent or when processing is unnecessary, excessive or noncompliant. Note that if your
                    information is deleted, then your account may become deactivated. If your account is deactivated or
                    you ask to close your account, you will no longer be able to use the Service. If you would like to
                    close your account in our system, you can do so through the Jobs233 Service (once you have logged
                    in,
                    visit settings / user settings, and then click on the close my account link).
                    Request Restriction of or Object to our processing of your personal information when processing is
                    noncompliant.
                    Withdraw your Consent to our processing of your personal information. If you refrain from providing
                    personal information or withdraw your consent to processing, some features of our Service may not be
                    available.
                    Request data portability and receive an electronic copy of personal information that you have
                    provided to us.
                    Be informed about third parties with which your personal information has been shared.
                    Request the review of decisions taken exclusively based on automated processing if that could affect
                    data subject rights.
                    Please see our Privacy Center for more information or to submit a request to us regarding your
                    Personal Information. Jobs233 uses automated means to calculate the Job Success Score of
                    Freelancers.
                    If you believe that our services have miscalculated your Job Success Score or you would like to
                    exercise any other rights with regard to your Personal Information, please email us at
                    privacyrequests@jobs233.com for assistance. We may be able to assist you by conducting a manual
                    review of your Job Success Score, such as by assessing whether the information you’ve provided us is
                    accurate. While we strongly encourage you to first raise any questions or concerns about your
                    Personal Information directly with us, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the relevant
                    supervisory authority and to seek judicial remedy.
                    We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your requests for deletion; however, certain
                    information will actively persist on the Service even if you close your account, including
                    information in your Work Diaries and messages you posted to the Service. In addition, the rights
                    described above may be limited, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal
                    information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information we are required by law to
                    keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as for fraud prevention purposes).
                    Your Personal Information may remain in our archives and information you update or delete, or
                    information within a closed account, may persist internally for our administrative purposes, to the
                    extent permitted by law. In addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly
                    through or on the Service. Bear in mind that neither you nor Jobs233 can delete all copies of
                    information that has been previously shared with others on the Service.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2"> 7. SECURITY</p>
                    We take a number of steps to protect your data, but no security is guaranteed.
                    Jobs233 takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the information it collects
                    and stores about Jobs233 Users. All access to the Site is encrypted using industry-standard
                    transport
                    layer security technology (“TLS”). When you enter sensitive information (such as tax identification
                    number), we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology
                    (“SSL”). We also use HTTP strict transport security to add an additional layer of protection for our
                    Jobs233 Users. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
                    electronic
                    storage, is 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, Jobs233 cannot
                    ensure and does not warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2"> 8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
                    Because we are a U.S. company, we process and store your information in the United States and our
                    service providers may process and store it elsewhere.
                    Jobs233 is a U.S. company. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide
                    information to us, Jobs233 transfers Personal Information to the United States for processing, and
                    our service providers may process Personal Information in the United States and elsewhere. These
                    countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided
                    the information. When we transfer your information to the United States, we will protect it as
                    described in this Privacy Policy.
                    When we transfer Personal Information from territories in the EEA or with similar laws to our
                    affiliates or service providers in the United States and elsewhere outside the EEA, we rely on
                    approved data transfer mechanisms, which may include standard contractual clauses approved by the
                    European Commission and the Privacy Shield, as described below. You may request a copy of the
                    standard contractual clauses relevant to your Personal Information, if any, using the contact
                    information below.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2"> 9. PRIVACY SHIELD NOTICE</p>
                    Jobs233 and its affiliates Jobs233 Inc., Jobs233 Escrow Inc., Elance, Inc., and Jobs233 Talent
                    Group,
                    Inc. have certified that their U.S. operations adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
                    Frameworks (“Privacy Shield”) with respect to the Personal Information that they receive in reliance
                    on the Privacy Shield. Our Privacy Shield certification is available at

                    https://www.privacyshield.gov.
                    When Jobs233 or one of its affiliates receives Personal Information under the Privacy Shield and
                    then
                    transfers it to a third party service provider acting as an agent on their behalf, Jobs233 or its
                    affiliate may have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes
                    the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) Jobs233 or its
                    affiliate is
                    responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
                    Covered European residents should contact Jobs233 at the contact information below regarding
                    Jobs233’s
                    or its affiliates' compliance with the Privacy Shield. Jobs233 will attempt to answer your questions
                    and satisfy your concerns in a timely and complete manner as soon as possible. If, after discussing
                    the matter with Jobs233, your issue or complaint is not resolved, Jobs233 and the above-named
                    affiliates have agreed to participate in the Privacy Shield independent dispute resolution
                    mechanisms listed below, free of charge to you. PLEASE CONTACT JOBS233 FIRST.
                    For other Personal Information Jobs233 or its affiliates receive under the Privacy Shield, Jobs233
                    and
                    its affiliates have committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-U.S. and
                    Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, JAMS Privacy
                    Shield Dispute Resolution, operated by JAMS. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your
                    complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit
                    https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information and to file a complaint.
                    If your complaint still is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, an
                    additional binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield panel, as described
                    at https://www.privacyshield.gov. Every individual also has a right to lodge a complaint with the
                    relevant supervisory authority.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">  10. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</p>
                    Our Service contains links to other websites. If you choose to click on a third party link, you will
                    be directed to that third party’s website. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement,
                    authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement
                    of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over
                    third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
                    computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you. We encourage you to read the
                    privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">11. PUBLIC PROFILE</p>
                    The profile you create on our Site will be publicly accessible unless otherwise indicated. You may
                    change the privacy settings of your profile through your account portal.
                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">12. PHISHING</p>
                    Phishing websites imitate legitimate websites in order to obtain personal or financial information.
                    Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to Jobs233. For
                    more information about phishing, visit the website of the Federal Trade Commission at
                    http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0003-phishing. In addition, if you believe you have received an
                    email or had a similar interaction with a third party pretending to be Jobs233, please report it at
                    https://support.jobs233.com.

                    <p class="t-bold t-orange mt-2">13. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</p>
                    We may change this Privacy Policy. If we make substantial changes, we will provide notice.
                    Jobs233 may update this Privacy Policy at any time and any changes will be effective upon
                    posting. In
                    the event that there are substantial changes to the way we treat your Personal Information, we will

                    by email, in our discretion. However, we will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent
                    with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you consent to
                    the new or revised policy.

                    This Supplemental Privacy Notice for California Residents supplements the information in our Privacy
                    Policy above, and except as provided herein, applies solely to California residents. It applies to
                    personal information we collect on or through the Service and through other means (such as
                    information collected offline, in person, and over the telephone). It does not apply to personal
                    information we collect from our employees or job applicants in their capacity as employees and job
                    applicants. It also does not apply to information we collect about businesses that use our Service
                    -- including any employees, owners, directors, officers, or contractors of those businesses -- in
                    the course of our provision or receipt of business-related services.
                    Summary of Information We Collect
                    California law requires us to disclose information regarding the categories of personal information
                    that we have collected about California consumers (as that term is defined in the California
                    Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA")), the categories of sources from which the information was collected,
                    the business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined by applicable law) for which the
                    information was collected, and the categories of parties with whom we share personal information.
                    We or our service providers may collect the below categories of information for the following
                    business or commercial purposes (as those terms are defined in applicable law):
                    Providing the Service (e.g., account servicing and maintenance, matching freelancer talent with
                    client needs, customer service, advertising and marketing, analytics, and communication about the
                    Service);
                    Our or our service providers' operational purposes;
                    Auditing consumer interactions on our site (e.g., measuring ad impressions);
                    Detecting, protecting against, and prosecuting privacy and security incidents and fraudulent or
                    illegal activity;
                    Bug detection, error reporting, and activities to maintain the quality or safety of our Service;
                    Investigating compliance with, enforcing, and/or complying with the law;
                    Short-term, transient use, such as customizing content that we or our service providers display on
                    the Service;
                    Improving our existing Service and developing new services (e.g., by conducting research to develop
                    new products or features);
                    Other uses that advance our commercial or economic interests, such as third party advertising and
                    communicating with you about relevant offers from us or third party partners;
                    Other uses about which we notify you.
                    Examples of these types of uses are identified below. We may also use the below categories of
                    personal information for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and we may combine the
                    information we collect (“aggregate”) or remove pieces of information (“de-identify”) to limit or
                    prevent identification of any particular user or device.
